# K-Means-Clustering-on-Happyscore-Dataset
Using K-Means Clustering method on happyscore dataset. It's allowing over 110 countries.

First I downloaded the dataset from the Internet. Then in my first lines, I imported the data set using pandas library.

Then I calculated some statistical measures over the data and printed them out. 

Then I visualized the data on the graph and started clustering on them. 
I noticed there was 3 center in this data. So I put 3 point on the graph.
